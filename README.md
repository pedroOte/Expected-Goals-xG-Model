# Expected-Goals-xG-Model
This repository contains a machine learning project to build an Expected Goals (xG) model for football/soccer. The model is trained using XGBoost on a dataset of over 292,000 shots. The project includes data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and a performance comparison with other models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
